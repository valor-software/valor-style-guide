- Short Description: TSLint is an extensible static analysis tool that checks TypeScript code for readability, maintainability, and functionality errors. It is widely supported across modern editors & build systems and can be customized with your own lint rules, configurations, and formatters.
- Human Description:
    - What?: TSLint is a static code analysis tool used in software development for checking Typescript code quality. TSLint checks your TypeScript code for readability, maintainability, and functionality errors. TSLint supports: an extensive set of core rules, custom lint rules, custom formatters (failure reporters), inline disabling and enabling of rules with comment flags in source code, configuration presets (tslint:latest, tslint-react, etc.) and plugin composition, automatic fixing of formatting & style violations
    - What For?: For catching common errors in programming or otherwise confusing constructs that are prone to producing bugs. Provide possibility to save code cleaner, more supportable and in the same style.
    - How?:
    >Note:

    tslint will have to use the same version of tsc used to actually compile your sources files.

    >Details:

    1. https://www.npmjs.com/package/tslint
    2. https://narayanatechnicalworld.blogspot.com/2016/05/what-is-tslint.html
```bash
npm install typescript -g //if you already install typescript, skip it.
npm install tslint

Generate tslint.json config file by just running the below command.
tslint --init
```

- Node
    - Exapmle: https://github.com/cbdr/CBSearchNode/blob/development/package.json
    - Link: https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json
- Short Description: The most important things in your package.json are the name and version fields as they will be required. The name and version together form an identifier that is assumed to be completely unique. Changes to the package should come along with changes to the version.
- Human Description:
    - What?:
    package.json holds various metadata relevant to the project.
    A package.json file:

      - lists the packages that your project depends on.
      - allows you to specify the versions of a package that your project can use using semantic versioning rules.
      - makes your build reproducible, and therefore much easier to share with other developers.
    - What For?: package.json is used to give information to npm that allows it to identify the project as well as handle the project's dependencies. It can also contain other metadata such as a project description, the version of the project in a particular distribution, license information, even configuration data - all of which can be vital to both npm and to the end users of the package. The package.json file is normally located at the root directory of a Node.js project.
    - How?:
    To create a package.json with values that you supply, run:

        ```bash
         npm init
        ```
      This will initiate a command line questionnaire that will conclude with the creation of a package.json in the directory in which you initiated the command.

    - Link: https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-lock.json
- Short Description: package-lock.json is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree, or package.json. It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.
- Human Description:
    - What?: Autogenerated file that describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.
    - What For?: The purpose of the package-lock is to avoid installing modules from the same package.json resulting in two different installs. The idea then becomes that instead of using package.json to resolve and install modules, npm will use the package-lock.json. Because the package-lock specifies a version, location and integrity hash for every module and each of its dependencies, the install it creates will be the same, every single time. It wonâ€™t matter what device you are on, or when in the future you install, it should give you the same result every time, which is very useful.
      package-lock.json serves various purposes:
        - Describe a single representation of a dependency tree such that teammates, deployments, and continuous integration are guaranteed to install exactly the same dependencies.

        - Provide a facility for users to "time-travel" to previous states of node_modules without having to commit the directory itself.

        - To facilitate greater visibility of tree changes through readable source control diffs.

        - Optimize the installation process by allowing npm to skip repeated metadata resolutions for previously-installed packages.
    - How?: Generates automatically

- Human Description:
    - What?: A module that loads environment variables from a .env file that you create and adds them to the process.env object that is made available to the application.
    - What For?: To assist in following situation:

      Applications that rely on third-party sources for data will at some point need to include things like OAuth tokens, SSH keys, or API credentials. This becomes an issue when the code for the application gets pushed up to a public facing source control like GitHub. Once the code is up there it is accessible to anyone that sees it. And so are your keys.
    - How?: Add the following line to your app.
      ```
          require('dotenv').config()
      ```
      Then create a .env file at the root directory of your application and add the variables to it.
      ```
          //contents of .env

          SECRET_KEY=abcd1234
      ```
          Finally, add â€˜.envâ€™ to your â€˜.gitignoreâ€™ file so that Git ignores it and it never ends up on GitHub. You can add any keys you want to this file.

    - What?: Configuration file for Jenkins (automation server), which orchestrates the build and manages the resulting outputs through scripted steps.
    - What For?: Jenkinsfile is used to to automate tasks associated with building, testing, and deploying software. The most common basic pipeline described in a Jenkinsfile consists of three stages: Build, Test, and Deploy.
      - The Build stage is typically where source code is assembled, compiled and packaged.
      - The Test stage, crucial to successful CI/CD processes, is enabled by a number of Jenkins plugins that facilitate test execution and results recording, which are visualized in the Web Dashboard UI.
      - The Deployment stage encompasses anything from publishing build artifacts to a management repository to pushing code to pre-production and production environments. Build jobs can be configured to stop upon any step failure, which increases build quality and reliability by not allowing failing code to progress through the deployment process, saving time and resources while reducing risk.

    Prettier takes your code and reprints it from scratch by taking the line length into account. Prettier enforces a consistent code style (i.e. code formatting that won't affect the AST) across your entire codebase because it disregards the original styling* by parsing it away and re-printing the parsed AST with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary. Basically it makes your code to adhere the same rules, which is useful while working as as team to maintain same code across the codebase.

- Human Description:
    - What?: A code of conduct is a set of rules outlining the social norms, religious rules and responsibilities of, and or proper practices for, an individual.
    - What For?: A well-written code of conduct clarifies an organization's mission, values and principles, linking them with standards of professional conduct. The code articulates the values the organization wishes to foster in leaders and employees and, in doing so, defines desired behavior. As a result, written codes of conduct or ethics can become benchmarks against which individual and organizational performance can be measured.
    Externally, a code serves several important purposes:

      - Compliance: Legislation (i.e., the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) requires individuals serving on boards and organizational leaders of public companies to implement codes or clearly explain why they have not.
      - Marketing: A code serves as a public statement of what the company stands for and its commitment to high standards and right conduct.
      - Risk Mitigation: Organizations with codes of ethics, and who follow other defined steps in the U.S. Sentencing Commission's Federal Sentencing Guidelines, can reduce the financial risks associated with government fines for ethical misconduct by demonstrating they have made a "good faith effort" to prevent illegal acts.
